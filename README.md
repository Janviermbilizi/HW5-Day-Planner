# Day Planner

<strong> Name </strong>

the name of this app is <i>Day Planner</i> as it is designed to plan and save daly events of the user.

<strong>Description</strong>

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio that can showcase my work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students a homework 5 to design a web application that users can use to plan their events and save them in their local storage

<strong>Programs used</strong>

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery, moment.js and bootstrap library and of course Git/Github were used as version control.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is only a website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://janviermbilizi.github.io/HW5-Day-Planner/

<strong>Usage</strong>

This website is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. When you go to the site, the header displays your today's day and date. below that, it displays a calendar with your work hours, 9 AM to 4PM. if that time is passed, the next column will have a silver color background that says <i>events happened</i> and will not allow you to record or save a new event. if that time is a current time, the next column will have a red color background that says <i>current event/time</i> and will not allow you to record or save a new event. if that time is a future time, the next column will have a green color background that displays your saved events or an input placeholder that allows you to record and save your future event.
